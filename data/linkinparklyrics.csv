Album,Song,LyricsHybrid Theory,Papercut,"Why does it feel like night today?Something in here's not right today.Why am I so uptight today?Paranoia's all I got leftI don't know what stressed me firstOr how the pressure was fedBut I know just what it feels likeTo have a voice in the back of my headLike a face that I hold insideA face that awakes when I close my eyesA face that watches every time I lieA face that laughs every time I fall(And watches everything)So I know that when it's time to sink or swimThat the face inside is here in meRight underneath my skin[Chester

eyesA face that watches every time they lieA face that laughs every time they fall(And watches everything)So you know that when it's time to sink or swimThat the face inside is watching you tooRight inside your skin[Chester Bennington:]It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my backIt's like a whirlwind inside of my headIt's like I can't stop what I'm hearing withinIt's like the face
