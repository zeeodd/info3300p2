Album,Song,LyricsKeith Urban,It's A Love Thing,"Yeah, yeahOoh it's a love thingI been working all day longAnd I'm ready to come on home to youAll the other guys roll their eyesAnd don't realize it's what I want to doIt's what I want to doThey say I'm wrapped around your fingerBut they don't understandThat what we got is more than just a diamondOn your handBaby it's a love thing, whoaBaby it's a love thing, yeahSure I could hang around and complain aboutThe way things ought to beYeah there's trouble in the worldBut you're the girlWhose open arms are all I really needAnd that's why I come runnin'To be there by your sideTo let 'em call me crazyBut it can't be deniedBaby it's a love thing, whoaBaby it's a love thing, yeahAnd it's not about the same last nameIt's not a thing that can be explainedIt's how you make me feel insideAnd the way you hold me everynightIt's a love thing, whoaOh baby, it's a love thing, yeahHe we go nowIt's a love thingThey say I'm wrapped around your fingerBut they don't understandThat what we got is more than just a diamondOn your handBaby it's a love thing, whoaOh baby it's a love thing, yeahCome on it's a love thing, whoaOh baby, It's a love thing, yeahOh, it's a love thing, whoaOh sugar, it's a love thingNo it ain't about no diamond ringIt's a love thing, whoaOh baby it's a love thing, yeahIt's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing"Keith Urban,Where The Blacktop Ends,"Gonna kick off my shoesAnd run in bare feetWhere the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meetGoin' back to the well gonna visit old friendsAnd feed my soul where the blacktop endsI'm lookin' down the barrel of Friday nightRidin' on a river of freeway lightsGoodbye city I'm country bound'Til Monday rolls aroundGonna kick off my shoesAnd run in bare feetWhere the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meetGoin' back to the well gonna visit old friendsAnd feed my soul where the blacktop endsWorkin' in the grind is an uphill roadPunchin' that clock and carryin' that loadI bust it all week and then I'm freeThe weekend belongs to meGonna kick off my shoesAnd run in bare feetWhere the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meetGoin' back to the well gonna visit old friendsAnd feed my soul where the blacktop endsGive me some fresh air give me that farmGive me some time with you in my armsFar away from the hustle and the pressure and the noiseGonna kick off my shoesAnd run in bare feetWhere the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meetGoin' back to the well gonna visit old friendsAnd feed my soul, you betchaGonna kick off my shoesAnd run in bare feetWhere the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meetGoin' back to the well gonna visit old friendsAnd feed my soul where the blacktop endsWhere the blacktop endsWhere the blacktop endsWhere the blacktop ends"Keith Urban,But For The Grace Of God,"I can hear the neighborsThey're arguin' againAnd there hasn't been peace on our streetSince who knows whenI don't mean to listen inBut the shoutin' is so loudI turn up the radio to drown it outAnd silently I say a little prayerBut for the grace of God go II must've been born a lucky guyHeaven only knows how I've been blessedWith the gift of you loveAnd I look around and all I seeIs your happiness embracing meOh Lord I'd be lostBut for the grace of GodI can see that old manHe's walking past our doorAnd I've been told that he's richBut he seems so poor'Cause no one comes to call on himAnd his phone it never ringsHe wanders through his empty homeSurrounnded by his thingsAnd silently I say a little prayer, yes I doBut for the grace of God go II must've been born a lucky guyHeaven only knows how I've been blessedWith the gift of you loveAnd I look around and all I seeIs your happiness embracing meOh Lord I'd be lostBut for the grace of GodI look around and all I seeIs your happiness embracing meOh Lord I'd be lostBut for the grace of GodOh Lord I'd be lostOh Lord I'd be lostBut for the grace of GodOh Lord I'd be lostBut for the grace of God"Keith Urban,Your

easyLike they used to come beforeThe awkwardness and boredomIs scattered out across the floorI can feel your love waxin' and wanin'And a quick look in your eyes needs no explainin'I'm out on my ownLivin' aloneI'm an old reluctant gypsyI don't like campin' anymoreAnd the dreams and disappointmentsScatter out across the floorI'm nervous on this train I feel it derailin'And I can read

woke up early this morning around 4amWith the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstateI pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleepBut thoughts of us kept keeping me

memories, I don't need'emTake your space and take your reasonsBut you'll think of meAnd take your cap and leave my sweater'Cause we have nothing left to weatherIn fact I'll feel a whole lot betterBut you'll think of me, you'll think of meI went out driving trying to clear my headI tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions leftI guess I'm feeling just a little tired of thisAnd all the baggage that seems to still existIt seems the only blessing I have left to my nameIs not knowing what we could have beenWhat we should have beenSoTake your records, take your freedomTake your memories, I don't need'emTake your space and take your reasonsBut you'll think of meAnd take your cap and leave my sweater'Cause we have nothing left to weatherIn fact I'll feel a whole lot betterBut you'll think of meSomeday I'm gonna run across your mindDon't worry, I'll be fineI'm gonna be alrightWhile you're sleeping with your prideWishing I could hold you tightI'll be over youAnd on with my lifeSo take your records, take your freedomTake your memories, I don't need'emAnd take your cap and leave my sweater'Cause we have nothing left to weatherIn

built a bridge, I tore it downI felt safe on shaky groundAnd I was a master of despairMaking believe I didn't careI shouldn't be standing here todayAfter all the crazy things I've doneI'm ready to fall and that's OKI ran as far as I could runYou wonOut of a world turned upside downIt took some time to come aroundOut of a dream you made me wholeYes you didYou lit a fire down in my soulI shouldn't be standing here todayAfter all the crazy things I've doneI'm ready to fall and that's OKI ran as far as I could runYou wonI shouldn't be standing here todayAfter all the crazy things I've doneI'm ready to fall and that's OKI ran as far as I could runYou wonAnd you wonI'm ready to fallI thought I knew what I was doingI thought I was in controlI thought nobody could slow me downBut what did I knowI was just a kid, a motherless childNo one to watch over me I was runnin' wildFree of all responsibility 'til my lifeAnd my love for myself caught up with meYeah, it caught up with meAnd now I'm (ready to fall), yes I amSo ready"Golden Road,Song For Dad,"Lately I've been noticingI say the same things he used to sayAnd I even find myself acting the very same wayI tap my fingers on the tableTo the rhythm in my soulAnd I jingle the car keys When I'm ready to goWhen I look in the mirrorHe's right there in my eyesStarin' back at me and I realizeThe older I getThe more I can seeHow much he loved my mother and my brother and meAnd he did the best that he couldAnd I only hope when I have my own familyThat everyday I seeA little more of my father in meThere were times I thought he was bein'Just a little bit hard on meBut now I understand he was makin' me Become the man he knew that I could beIn everything he ever didHe always did with loveAnd I'm proud today to say I'm his sonWhen somebody says I hope I get to meet your dadI just smile and say you already haveThe older I getThe more I can seeHow much he loved my mother and my brother and meAnd he did the best that he couldAnd I only hope when I have my own familyThat everyday I seeA little more of my father in meHe's in my eyesMy heart, my soulMy hands, my prideAnd when I feel aloneAnd I think I can't go onI hear him sayin' ""Son you'll be alright""Everything's gonna be alright""Yes it isThe older I getThe more I can seeThat he loved my mother and my brother and meAnd he did the best that he couldAnd I only hope when I have my own familyThat everyday I seeOh I hope I seeI hope everyday I seeA little more of my father in

never lets up on you Who said life was easyThe job is never throughIt'll run us 'til we're raggedIt'll harden our heartsAnd love could use a day of restBefore we both start falling apartPray

dark I was no strangerBut this was stronger than I'd knownAnd by the time I knew that I was in too deep I'd gone too farAnd the light that used to guide meHad faded from my heartAnd I found

keep believing in myself When all I felt was so much pain and guilt and shameI couldn't even ask for helpI don't know if I believe in other livesBut when you cameThere was something so familiarAbout the way you said my nameAnd the whole world started turningAnd I swear that I'd been born again brand newAnd it's all because of you[Chorus]And I've seen so many thingsThat I just can't explainBut the miracle of miracles is howWith your love I was saved[Chorus]And I thank you for my heartI thank you for my lifeI thank god for grace and mercyAnd that you became my
